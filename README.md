 This assignment intends for us to do an exploratory Data Analysis of Population, GDP, and
 Vehicle Sales Data for 3 countries: United Kingdom, United Arab Emirates and Malaysia.
 Subsequently, identifying trends and insights by making graphs of relevant data to see patterns
 and notice any correlation between the data. We will do this by applying data wrangling,
 visualization, and statistical techniques. We will start this assignment by importing the necessary
 libraries and reading the files for each dataset and saving them as a dataframe. Then we will
 analyse and understand the data in order to clean the data and data wrangle it which will let us
 easily plot graphs and charts to visualize the trends.

# Exploratory Data Analysis on Population, GDP, and Vehicle Sales

This project performs an **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on **Population, GDP**, and **Vehicle Sales data** for three countries:  
 United Kingdom, United Arab Emirates, and Malaysia.

## 📊 Objective

The goal is to:
- Identify trends and patterns in each dataset
- Explore possible correlations between population, GDP, and vehicle sales
- Apply data wrangling, visualization, and basic statistical techniques to gain insights

---

## 🛠️ Methods & Libraries

- **Python** (Jupyter Notebook)
- **Libraries used**: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `numpy`
- Data wrangling to clean and preprocess the datasets
- Visualizations to uncover relationships and trends

---

## 📁 Files Included

- `cw1.ipynb` – Main notebook with all analysis, code, and visualizations
- `README.md` – You’re here!
