 This assignment intends for us to do an exploratory Data Analysis of Population, GDP, and
 Vehicle Sales Data for 3 countries: United Kingdom, United Arab Emirates and Malaysia.
 Subsequently, identifying trends and insights by making graphs of relevant data to see patterns
 and notice any correlation between the data. We will do this by applying data wrangling,
 visualization, and statistical techniques. We will start this assignment by importing the necessary
 libraries and reading the files for each dataset and saving them as a dataframe. Then we will
 analyse and understand the data in order to clean the data and data wrangle it which will let us
 easily plot graphs and charts to visualize the trends.
